### CIA Triad
1. Confidentiality
    - only authorized users could access data
    - public/private information

2. Integrity
    - data should not be modified by unauthorized users
    - data should be correct and authentic

3. Availability
    - network should be operational to authorized users

**Vulnerability** - potential weakness that compromise CIA of a system

**Exploit** - something that can be used to exploit the vulnerability

**Threat** - potential of a vulnerability to be exploited

**Mitigation Technique** - something that can protect against threats

**AAA** - Authentication, Authorization and Accounting
- Authentication: process of verifying user's identity
- Authorization: process of granting user the appropriate access and permission
- Accounting - process of recording user's activities on the system
- Cisco AAA server: ISE (Identity Services Engine)
- AAA Protocols:
    1. RADIUS - UDP 1812 / UDP 1813
    2. TACACS+ - TCP 49 (only for Cisco)

### Common Attacks
1. Denial-of-service attacks (DoS)
    - attacker use fake ip to send TCP SYN message to target
    - target send SYN-ACK message to the attacker
    - attacker never send ACK message back
    - instead, attacker send another SYN message and repeat the same process
    - target no longer able to make legitimate TCP connections
    - SYN flood

2. Distributed Denial-of-service attacks (DDoS)
    - attacker infects many target computer with malware and use them to initiate DoS attack
    - **botnet** - infected computers

3. Spoofing Attack
    - use fake source address (i.e. ip/mac)
    - example: DHCP exhaustion attack / DoS attack

4. Reflection/Amplification Attack
    - Reflection attack
    - attacker send traffic to reflector using target IP (spoofing)
    - reflector send reply that is large enough to target IP
    - this can result in DoS

    - Reflection ---> Amplification when attacker send small amount traffic but trigger large amount of traffic sent from reflector

5. Man-in-the-middle attack
    - attacker locate between source and destination to aevesdrop on communication / modify traffic
    - e.g. ARP spoofing / ARP poisoning
        - host send ARP request
        - server send ARP reply
        - attacker wait and send another ARP reply after the correct replier
        - the later ARP reply (send by attacker) will overwrite host
        s ARP table
        - the traffic after will send to attacker since host's ARP table storing attacker's MAC address

6. Reconnaissance attack
    - used to gather information about target
    - often publicly available information

7. Malware
    - harmful programs that can infect a computer
    - example:
        1. Virus
            - spread as the software is shared by users
            - can corrupt or modify files on target computer
        2. Worms
            - standalone malware and able to spread on their own
            - can congest the network
            - payload can cause additional harm 
        3. Trojan Horses
            - spread through user interaction like email attachments / download files

8. Social Enginnering Attacks
    - example:
        1. Phishing
            - e.g. **spear phishing** - aim at employees of a certain company
            - e.g. **whaling** - phishing targeted at high-profile individuals
        2. Vishing
            - voice phishing
        3. Smishing
            - SMS phishing
        4. Watering Hole
            - attacks compromise sites that target victim frequently visits
        5. Tailgating
            - entering restricted areas by simply walking in behind an authorized person as they enter

9. Password-related attacks
    - can learn user's password via:
        1. guessing
        2. dictionary attacks
        3. brute force attacks

## Authentication
### Multi-factor Authentication
- involves two of the following:
    1. Something you know - username/password
    2. Something you have - pressng a notification appeared on phone
    3. Something you are - biometrics

### Digital certificates
- prove the identity of the holder of the certificate
- verify that the website being accessed is legitimate
- entities send CSR (Certificate Signing Request) to CA (Certificate Authority)

### Security Program Elements
1. User awareness
    - make employees aware of potential security attacks

2. User Training
    - training sessions educating users on corporate security policies

3. Physical access control
    - protect equipment and data from potential attacks by only allowing authorized users into protected areas
    - e.g. access card
