```
**Preamble + Start Frame Delimiter (SFD)**
- 7 + 1 bytes
- (10101010 * 7) + (10101011) 
- Preamble: allow device to synchronize receiver clocks
- SFD: Act as end of preamble and the beginning of the rest of the frame

**Destination / Source**
- 6 bytes each
- consist destination and source MAC address

**Type (Sometime Length)**
- 2 bytes
- (value <= 1500) - indicates length in bytes
- (value >= 1536) - indicates type (normally IPv4/IPv6)
    - IPv4 - 2048 in decimal | 0x0800 in hexadecimal
    - IPv6 - 34525 in decimal | 0x86DD in hexadecimal

**Frame Check Sequence (FCS)**
- 4 bytes
- used to detect any error occurred / corrupted data by running **Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)** algorithm 

**Data/Payload**
- Preamble + SFD usually not part of header
- Min size of eth frame is 64 bytes
- 64 - (Header w/o Preamble + SFD)(6 + 6 + 2) - (Trailer)(4) = 46
- so 46 bytes is the min size of payload (padding bytes are added if the size is smaller )

### MAC Address
- Media Access Control
- 6 bytes physical address assigned to device
- globally unique
- written as 12 hexadecimal chars
- First 3 bytes - Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI)
- Last 3 bytes - unique to device itself

**Unicast frame** - frame destined for a single target

**Unknown Unicast frame** 
- same as unicast frame 
- but not sure where the destination is
- as destination MAC addr is not one of the entry in switch's MAC addr table
- solution: flood (i.e. copy the frame and send out its interfaces to 
find the destination)

**Broadcast frame**
- sent to all hosts on the network

**Dynamic MAC Address** 
- switch learned from the frames to know the source MAC and associated interface (i.e. Not manually configure)
- stored in MAC address table when receive the frame
- removed after 5 mins of inactivity
- Command
    - show the mac addr table - `show mac address-table`
        - VLAN, MAC Addr, Type, Port
    - clear all - `clear mac address-table dynamic`
    - clear specific mac address - `clear mac address-table dynamic address <MAC Addr>`
    - clear w interface - `clear mac address-table dynamic interface <interface>`

**Address Resolution Protoco (ARP)**
- hexadecimal (0x0806)
- when sending one packet, we only know destination IP addr but not MAC addr
- ARP is then used to find the MAC addr using known IP addr
- ARP Request sent by source endhost (broadcast - FFFF.FFFF.FFFF)
- ARP Reply sent by destination endhost (unicast)
- Command: 
    - show arp table - `show arp` (Cisco IOS) / `arp -a` (Win/Linux)
        - Internet Addr, Physical Addr, Type

**Ping**
- used to test reachability
- measure round-trip time
- Must know destination IP addr and MAC addr before sending request 
- ICMP Echo Request sent by source endhost
- ICMP Echo Reply sent by destination endhost
- Command: `ping <IP Addr>`




The process of addresses being cleared from the MAC address table after 5 minutes of inactivity is known as **aging**

Ethernet Type code for an ARP packet is **0x0806**
