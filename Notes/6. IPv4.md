### IPv4
- 8+8+8+8 (bits) = 32 bits = 4 bytes
- 4 octets
- (ip addr)/24
    - /24 means the first 24 bits is network portion
    - rest is host portion
    - e.g. 192.168.2.1/24
        - binary: 11000000.10101000.00000010.00000001
        - network portion: 11000000.10101000.00000010
        - host portion: 00000001

### IPv4 Address Classes
- Class A 0.xxx.xxx.xxx is reserved address
- Class A 127.xxx.xxx.xxx is loopback address
    - used to test network stack on local device 
    - sending and receiving pings to and from itself
- Class D is Multicast addresses
- Class E is Reserved addresses for experimental purposes

- First address (each class) - network address
    - e.g. 192.168.2.0/24
- Last address (each class) - broadcast address
    - e.g. 192.168.2.255/24

| Class | First Octet | Numeric Range (First Octet) | Prefix Length |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | 0xxxxxxx | 0-127 | /8 |
| B | 10xxxxxx | 128-191 | /16 |
| C | 110xxxxx | 192-223 | /24 |
| D | 1110xxxx | 224-239 | - |
| E | 1111xxxx | 240-255 | - |

### Calculate Maximum Hosts/Address per Network
- Formula: `2^<Host Portion Bit Size> - 2`
- Excluding Network Address and Broadcast Address

### Calculate First/Last Usable Address
- First Usable Address: Network Address + 1
- Last Usable Address: Broadcast Address - 1

### Configuring IP Addresses (Router)
- `show ip interface brief` - status of each interface and IP address
    - interface
    - ip address
    - OK? (Legacy) - indicate whether ip addr is valid
    - Method - method to assign ip address
    - Status - indicate whether the interface is connected to other device **(Layer 1 Status)**
        - **administratively down (default)** - interface disabled with `shutdown` command
        - **up** - connected
    - Protocol - **(Layer 2 Status)**

- `interface <interface id>` - switch to interface configuration mode _(after switching to global configuration mode)_

- `ip address <ip addr> <subnet mask>` - assign ip addr and subnet mask _(after switching to interface configuration mode)_

- `show interfaces <interface id>` - show details of an interface _(after switching to global configuration mode)_

- `show interfaces description` - show usage of interfaces _(after switching to global configuration mode)_

- `description <desc msg>` - assign description message of the interface _(after switching to interface configuration mode)_
