### Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)
- used to filter ARP messages received (only) on untrusted ports
- check if sender IP/MAC received  == entries in DHCP snooping binding tables
- ARP ACLs can also be configured to perform DAI
    - suitable for hosts that don't use DHCP as there is no entry for this host in DHCP snooping binding table
- support rate-limiting (default: disabled on trusted port & 15 packets/sec on untrusted port)

### ARP Poisoning
- attacker send gratuitous ARP messages using another device's IP address
- the ARP messages flood and update endhosts' arp table
- endhosts send traffic to the attacker after updating


### Configuration
- `ip arp inspection vlan <vlan id>`
- `ip arp inspection trust` (**interface config mode**)
- `ip arp inspection limit rate <rate>`
- `ip arp inspection limit rate <rate> burst interval <sec>`
- `ip arp inspection validate <validation1, validation2...>`
    - validation will be overwritten if write command in different line
    - to enable all validation: `ip arp inspection validate dst-mac ip src-mac`
    - dst-mac: check if dest MAC in Ethernet header == dest MAC in ARP Response
    - ip: enable validation on 
        1. network address
        2. broadcast address
        3. multicast address
        4. sender IP in ARP Request/Reply
        5. dest IP in ARP Reply 
    - src-mac: check if source MAC in Ethernet header == sender MAC in ARP request/reply
- `show ip arp inspection` - overview of ARP Inspection
    - if **static ACL** == yes, implicit deny at the end of ARP ACL will take effect
    - cause all ARP messages denied
    - dhcp snooping table will not be checked
- `show ip arp inspection interfaces`
    - **burst interval** - control the "y sec" in "x packets per y sec"
- `errdisable recovery cause arp-inspection`

ARP ACLs:
- `arp access-list <arp acl name>`
- `<permit/deny> ip <source ip> mac host <source mac>`
- `ip arp inspection filter <arp acl name> vlan <vlan id>` - apply ARP ACL configured on specified vlan
