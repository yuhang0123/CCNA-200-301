### Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
- allow host to automatically or dynamically learn their network configuration (e.g. ip / subnet mask / default gateway / dns...)
- used for client devices
- DHCP server: router (small network) / Windows/Linus server (large network)
- When DHCP server in local network, it can indicate client's MAC address by looking on the source MAC in the packet
- When DHCP server is in remote network, it indicates client's MAC address via CHADDR (Client Hardware Address)

### Working Principle
`ipconfig /release`
- give up current network configuration gotten

<br>


```
- source IP: current client IP
- destination IP: current server IP
- unicast

Client ---------------------> Server
```

<br>

`ipconfig /renew`
- get network configuration from DHCP server

<br>

```
        DHCP Discover: ANY DHCP SERVER?
        - src MAC: client MAC
        - dest MAC: FFFF.FFFF.FFFF
        - src IP: 0.0.0.0 (already gave up previous IP)
        - dest IP: 255.255.255.255
        - broadcast
       --------------------->

        DHCP Offer: HOW ABOUT THIS IP?
        - src MAC: server MAC
        - dest MAC: client MAC
        - src IP: server IP
        - dest IP: client IP / 255.255.255.255
        - unicast / broadcast (depends on Bootp in DHCP discover)
       <---------------------

        DHCP Request: I WANT TO USE THE IP OFFERED
        - src MAC: client MAC
        - dest MAC: FFFF.FFFF.FFFF
        - src IP: 0.0.0.0 (IP havent assigned yet)
        - dest IP: 255.255.255.255
        - broadcast
       --------------------->

        DHCP ACK: YOU CAN USE IT
        - src MAC: server MAC
        - dest MAC: client MAC
        - src IP: server IP
        - dest IP: client IP (confirmed)
        - unicast / broadcast (depends on Bootp in DHCP discover)
Client <--------------------- Server
```

### DHCP Relay
- large network use centralized DHCP server instead of router
- DHCP broadcast message can't received by DHCP server as broadcast message don't leave local subnet
- DHCP relay agent forward client's broadcast DHCP message to remote DHCP server (unicast)

<br>
<hr>
<br>

### DHCP Server Configuration
- `ip dhcp excluded-address <first addr> <last addr>` - specify range of addresses won't be assigned to DHCP clients
- `ip dhcp pool <pool name>` - create DHCP pool
    - preferred have separate pool for different subnets
- `network <network addr> <subnet mask>` - specify subnet of addresses to be assigned to clients
- `dns-server <dns ip>` - specify DNS server assigned to clients
- `domain-name <name>` - specify domain name of the network
- `default-router <ip>` - specify default gateway assigned to clients
- `lease <days> <hrs> <mins>` / `lease infinite` - specify least time
- `show ip dhcp binding` - show dhcp clients ip is assigned to

### DHCP Relay Agent Configuration (interface config mode)
- configure on interface connected to the subnet of client devices
- `ip helper-address <dhcp server ip>` - configure ip address of DHCP server as helper address

### DHCP Client Configuration (interface config mode)
- configure on interface connected to the subnet of DHCP server
- `ip address dhcp`
