### Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) 
Imagine a network only need 4 host addresses. If we assign 192.168.1.0/24, which has 2^8 - 2 = 254 usable addresses. After subtracting 4 addresses needed, 254 addresses would be wasted. Thus, to use the addresses more efficiently, subnetting is requred. 

- 192.168.1.0/25 = 128 - 2 = 126 usable addresses
- 192.168.1.0/26 = 64 - 2 = 62
- 192.168.1.0/27 = 32 - 2 = 30
- 192.168.1.0/28 = 16 - 2 = 14
- 192.168.1.0/29 = 8 - 2 = 6 (BEST as only 2 addresses is wasted)
- 192.168.1.0/30 = 4 - 2 = 2 (used for point to point network e.g. R1 to R2)
- 192.168.1.0/31 = 2 - 2 = 2 (used for point to point network e.g. R1 to R2 as network and broadcast address technically is not required)
- 192.168.1.0/32 = 1 (used for static routing)


When number of hosts per network is not mentioned, simply use 

- 2^x, where x = number of bits borrowed from host portion

to find the number of subnets


### Variable-Length Subnet Masks (VLSM)
- creating subnets of different sizes
- assign addresses to subnets following their size in descending order
