### First Hop Redundancy Protocol (FHRP)
- protect the default gateway by allowing two or more routers to provide backup
- active and standby router are chosen
- two routers send Hello message to each other to ensure both still working
- virtual IP configured on two routers 
- virtual MAC address is generated for the virtual IP
- end hosts configured to use the virtual IP as default gateway
- active router reply to ARP requests from end hosts using the virtual MAC address
- if active router fails (not sending Hello messages to another router after dead timer overs), standy become active router
- new active router send gratuitous ARP message to help switch update their MAC address table
- even the old active router come back online, it will become standby not active router (non-preemption), but this could be configured to preemption

**Gratuitous ARP** - ARP Reply message that are not requested

## Three types of FHRP
### Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP)
- only for Cisco
- active and standby routers are elected
- active router selection:
    1. highest priority (default 100)
    2. highest IP addr
- two versions:
    | V1 | V2 |
    | --- | --- | 
    | No Ipv6 support | Ipv6 support|
    | Less group | More Group |
    | Multicast: 224.0.0.2 | Multicast: 224.0.0.102 |
    | MAC: 0000.0c07.acXX | MAC: 0000.0c9f.fXXX |

    **XX/XXX = HSRP group numbers**
- can configure different active/standby router in each VLAN/subnet


### Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP)
- open standard
- master and backup are elected (aka active / standby)
- Multicast: 224.0.0.18
- MAC: 0000.5e00.01XX (XX = VRRP group number)
- can configure different active/standby router in each VLAN/subnet

### Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP)
- only for Cisco
- load balance among multiple router within a single subnet 
- An Active Virtual Gateway (AVG) is elected
- AVG assign up to 4 Active Vitual Forwarders (AVF), which act as the default gateway for a portion of the hosts in the subnet
- Multicast: 224.0.0.102
- MAC: 0007.b400.XXYY (XX = GLBP group number, YY = AVF number)

### HSRP Configuration
- `standby version <version>` - change the version of HSRP
- `standby <group number> ip <ip addr>` - change the virtual ip addr
- `standby <group number> priority <priority>` - change the priority val
- `standby <group number> preempt` - enable/disable preemption
