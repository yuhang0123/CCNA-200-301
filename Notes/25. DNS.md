### DNS
- resolve names to IP addresses
- DNS server can be manually configured or learned via DHCP
- A record = used to map names to IPv4
- AAAA record = used to map names to IPv6
- normally udp is used,unless messages greater than 512 bytes 
- once gotten DNS reply, device will save it in DNS cache (Win Command: `ipconfig /displaydns` (show DNS cache) / `ipconfig /flushdns` (clear DNS cache))
- alternative: save hostname and ip in file path `Windows/System32/drivers/etc`
- Command:
    - `ip dns server` - enable router to be DNS server
    - `ip host <hostname> <ip>` - configure entries in the host table
    - `ip name-server <ip>` - configure another DNS server that router will query if the record isn't in its host table
    - `ip domain-lookup` - enable router to perform DNS queries (default enabled)
    - `show host` - view all the host in host table
    - `ip domain name <name>` - configure the default domain name
        - when `ping pc1`, it became `ping pc1.<domain name>`
