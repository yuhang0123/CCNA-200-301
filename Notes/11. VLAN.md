**Broadcast Domain** - group of devices which will receive a broadcast frame sent by any one of the members

### Rules of VLAN
1. Switch will not forward traffic between VLANs
2. switch must send traffic through router (no inter-VLAN routing)
3. configured on switch on per-switch basis

### Command
1. `show vlan brief` - show all the VLANs
2. `switchport mode access` - set specific interface as access port
3. `switchport access vlan <vlan num>` - set specific interface to an access vlan
4. `vlan <vlan num>` - create vlan and enter (if not exist) / enter (if exist)
5. `name` - set the name of vlan

### Trunk Ports
- carry traffic from multiple VLANs over a single interface (save interface usage)
- switches will tag frames sent over a trunk link so the receiving switch know which VLAN the frame belongs to
- two trunking ports:
    - ISL (inter-Switch Link)
    - IEEE 802.1Q

### 802.1Q Tag
```
 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
|          |     |             |        |        |      |
| Preamble | SFD | Destination | Source | 802.1Q | Type |
|_ _ _ _ _ | _ _ | _ _ _ _ _ _ | _ _ _ _|_ _ _ _ | _ _ _|

```
- 4 bytes
- main fields:
    - Tag Protocol Identifier (TPID)
        - 16 bits
        - value is 0x8100
    - Tag Control Information (TCI)
        - PCP (Priority Code Point)
            - 3 bits
            - used for Class of Service - prioritize important traffic
        - DEI (Drop Eligible Indicator)
            - indicate frames that can be dropped if network congested
        - VID (VLAN ID)
            - 12 bits
            - identify the VLAN the frame belongs to
            - total of 4096 VLANs
            - first and last is reserved
            - Normal VLANs: 1 - 1005
            - Extended VLANs (some old switches cannot use): 1006 - 4094

### Native VLAN
- VLAN 1 by default on all trunk ports but can manually configured
- switches do not add 802.1Q tag to the frames in native VLAN
- **IMPORTANT: ALWAYS MAKE SURE NO NATIVE VLAN MISMATCH**

### Command (Switch Configuration)
- `switchport trunk encapsulation <trunking ports>` - set the encapsulation type of switch (for switches that support both ISL and 802.1Q)
- `switchport mode trunk` - set interface as trunk port (only 802.1Q trunking port can use this)
- `show interfaces trunk` - view all the trunking ports details
- `switchport trunk allowed vlan <action> vlan <vlan num>` - determine which vlan is allowed to use this trunk port (default: all VLANs are allowed)
- `switchport trunk native vlan <vlan num>` - set the native vlan number
- `show interfaces <interface id> switchport` - view the details of specific trunking/access ports

### Router on a Stick (ROAS)
- instead of using three connections, now use only one connection to connect router and switch
- used for inter-vlan routing
- G0/0.1, G0/0.2, G0/0.3... subinterfaces for different vlan but they are all from G0/0

## Command (Router Configuration)
- `encapsulation dot1q <vlan num>` - tell a specific subinterface what vlan to deal with 
- `encapsulation dot1q <vlan num> native ` - set native vlan

### Layer 3 Switch / Multilayer Switch
- capable of switching and routing
- can assign ip address to switch virtual interfaces (SVI)
    - used for gateway addresses on PCs
    - used for inter-vlan routing

### Command (Multilayer Switch Configuration)
- `ip routing` - enable Layer 3 routing on multilayer switch
- `no switchport` - switch layer 2 switchport to layer 3 routed port on an interface
- `interface <vlan num>` - start configuration on a SVI
    - to make the SVI to be up/up:
        - vlan must exist
        - switch must have at least one access/trunk port in the vlan in an up/up state
        - vlan must not be shutdown
        - SVI must not be shutdown
