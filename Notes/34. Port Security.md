### Port Security
- security feature of Cisco Switches
- control allowed source MAC to enter the switchport
- if unauthorized MAC enters, action will be taken (e.g. err-disabled)
- when port security enabled, only one MAC is allowed
    - can be manually configured
    - or allow the first source MAC entering the port
    - maximum number of MAC allowed can be changed
- **(Recommend):** instead of specifying MAC allowed, limit the number of MAC allowed is more useful

### Configuration
- `switchport port-security` (**interface config mode**)
    - only work when the port is access/trunk port (not auto/desirable port)
- `switchport port-security mac-address <mac>` - configure allowed MAC
- `switchport port-security maximum <max val>` - configure maximum allowed MAC
- `show port-security interface <interface id>`
    - Violation mode:
        1. Shutdown (Default)
            - place port in err-disabled state
            - generate syslog/SNMP message when port is disabled
            - violation counter += 1 when shutdown
        2. Restrict
            - switch ignore traffic from unauthorized MAC
            - port is not disabled
            - generate Syslog/SNMP Trap message each time detected unauthorized MAC
            - violation counter += 1 when detected
            - `switchport port-security violation restrict`
        3. Protect
            - switch ignore traffic from unauthorized MAC address
            - interface is not disabled
            - not generate Syslog/SNMP Trap message
            - not increment violation counter
            - `switchport port-security violation protect`
    - secure mac address aging
        - only dynamic mac will aged out, static won't
        - `switchport port-security aging static` - aged out static MAC
        - `switchport port-security aging time <min>`
        - `switchport port-security aging type <absolute/inactivity>`
            - absolute - timer won't renew when received frames from the source MAC
            - inactivity - timer will renew when received frames from the source MAC
- `show port-security` - show overview of port security
- `errdisable recovery cause psecure-violation`
- `switchport port-security mac-address sticky`

### Sticky Secure MAC address
- when enabled, all dynamic MAC (previous and future) won't aged out
- when disabeld, all dyanmic MAC (previous and future) will aged out
- have to save to startup-config to avoid losing these MAC
- **static** type shown in mac address table
