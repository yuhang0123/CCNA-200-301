### Private IPv4 Address
- Class A: 10.0.0.8/8
- Class B: 172.16.0.0/12
- Class C: 192.168.0.0/16
- no need to be globally unique
- cannot be used over the Internet
- NAT convert private IP addr into another public IP addr when accessing Internet

### Network Address Translation (NAT)
1. Source NAT
    - convert **private source** IP to **public source** IP when sending out the packet to Internet
    - convert **public destination** IP to **private destination** IP when receiving packet from the Internet

2. Static NAT
    - configure one-to-one mapping of private IP to public IP
    - no need to be one private one global
    - **inside local**: IP of inside host  from perspective of local network (usually private)
    - **inside global**: IP of inside host from perspective of outside host (usually public)
    - `ip nat inside` (**interface config mode**) - define inside interface connected to internal network
    - `ip nat outside` (**interface config mode**) - define outside interface connected to external network
    - `ip nat inside source static <inside local ip> <inside global ip>` (**global config mode**)
        - different private IP can't map to same public IP (**ERROR**)

3. Dynamic NAT
    - acl is used
        - source IP permitted by ACL will be translated
        - source IP denied by ACL will not be translater (not dropping packet)
    - NAT pool is used to define available inside global addresses that can be used
    - **NAT Pool Exhaustion** - not enough inside global addr for inside local use
        - router will drop the packet
        - host unable to access outside network until there is inside global addr available
        - entries time out automatically if not used / can be cleared manually
    - `ip nat inside`
    - `ip nat outside`
    - `access-list <acl num> <permit/deny> <source ip>`
    - `ip nat pool <pool name> <start ip> <end ip> (prefix-length <prefix> / netmask <netmask>)` - define NAT pool
    - `ip nat inside source list <acl num> pool <pool name>` - configure dynamic NAT

4. PAT (NAT Overload)
    - translate both IP and port
    - e.g. 
        PC1: 192.168.0.167:54321 -> 100.0.0.1:54321
        PC2: 192.168.0.168:54321 -> 100.0.0.1:54322
    - router keep track of which inside local addr is using which inside global addr and port
    - `ip nat inside`
    - `ip nat outside`
    - `access-list <acl num> <permit/deny> <source ip>`
    - `ip nat pool <pool name> <start ip> <end ip> (prefix-length <prefix> / netmask <netmask>)`
    - `ip nat inside source list <acl num> pool <pool name> overload`

    OR

    - instead of configuring NAT pool, use router exit interface IP as inside global IP addr
    - remove NAT pool configuration command
    - `ip nat inside source list <acl num> interface <interface id> overload`

`show ip nat translations`
- inside global
- inside local
- **outside local**: ip address of outside host from perspective of local network
- **outside global**: ip address of outside host from perspective of outside network

`clear ip nat translation *`

`show ip nat statistics`
