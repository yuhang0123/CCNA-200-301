### API (Application Programming Interface)
- software interface that allows two applications to communicate with each other
- Southbound APIs: NETCONF & RESTCONF

### CRUD
- create: used to create new variable to set their initial values
- read: used to retrieve the value of a vaiable
- update: used to change the value of a variable
- delete: used to delete variables
- REST APIs use HTTP use CURD

| Crud Operation | HTTP Verb |
| --- | --- |
| Create | POST |
| Read | GET |
| Update | PUT&PATCH |
| Delete | DELETE |

### HTTP Request
- Header: HTTP verb + URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)
- URI: scheme (HTTPS) + authority (domain) + path

### HTTP Response
- 1xx - informational
    - 102 - processing
- 2xx - successful
    - 200 - OK
    - 201 - Created
- 3xx - redirection
    - 301 - Moved Permanently
- 4xx - client error
    - 403 - Unauthorized
    - 404 - Not Found
- 5xx - server error

### REST API / Rest-based APIs / RESTful APIs
- Representational State Transfer
- 6 constraints of architecture:
    1. uniform interface
    2. **client-server**
        - client use API calls (aka HTTP request) to access the resource on server
    3. **stateless**
        - each API exchange is a separate event
        - client must authenticate with the server for each request it makes
    4. **cacheable or non-chacheable**
        - storing data for future use
    5. layered system
    6. code-on-demand
