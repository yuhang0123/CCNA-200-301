### Access Control List
- instructing router to permit/discard specific trafic
- based on source/destination IP/ports
- configured in **global config mode** + apply to interface (inbound/outbound)
- made up of ordered sequence of ACEs (Access Control Entries)
- process ACEs in order (top to bottom)
- if one ACE match, stop processing ACL **(ORDER MATTERS!)**
- implicit deny - no ACE is matched
    - deny the packet
- only one ACL is allowed on an interface

### ACL types
1. Standard ACLs
    - match based on source IP address
    - should be applied as close to the destination as possible
    - order of ACEs might changed after configured (re-order /32 entries) but not changing the effect of ACL
    - example:
        1. Standard Numbered ACLs: ACL1, ACL2...
            - 1-99 / 1300-1999
            - `access-list <number> <deny/permit> <ip> <wildcard-mask>`
            - without widcard mask (only for standard) / adding "host" before ip = /32 
            - `access-list <number> <deny/permit> any` - permit/deny rest of the source ip
            - `access-list <number> remark <description>` - add description
        2. Standard Named ACLs: name
            - configured by entering standard named ACL config mode
            - `ip access-list standard <acl name>` - enter standard named ACL config mode
            - `<sequence number (opt)> <deny/permit> <ip> <wildcard mask>`

2. Extended ACLs
    - match based on source/destination IP and source/destination port
    - should be applied as close to the source as possible
    - example:
        1. Extended Numbered ACLs
            - 100-199 / 2000 - 2699
            - `access-list <number> <deny/permit> <protocol/port> <src ip> <dest ip>`
        2. Extended Named ACLs
            - `ip access-list extended <acl name/num>`
            - `<sequence number (opt)> <deny/permit> <protocol/port> <source ip> <dest ip>`
            - for tcp and udp, can specify the source and destination port
            - `<sequence number (opt)> <deny/permit> <tcp/udp> <source ip> <inequality> <source port num> <destination ip> <inequality> <dest port num>`
                - inequality:
                - eq (==)
                - gt (>)
                - lt (<)
                - neq (!=)
                - range <start> <end>

`show access-lists`
`show ip access-list`
`show ip interface <interface id>` - able to view which ACL applied to the interface
`ip access-group <number> <in/out>` - apply ACL to an interface (interface config mode)
`show running-config | include access-list` - show access list without entries and remark
`show running-config | section access-list` - show access list without name (more details for standard named ACL; same for standard number ACL)
`ip access-list resequence <acl id> <start num> <increment>` - resequence the sequence number of entries 


**Note**
- can use method in Named ACL to create Number ACL
- easy to delete entries in Number ACL with `no <sequence number>` **(in standard named config mode)**
- if using traditional method in Number ACl, this command will detele the entire ACL

**Only add "ip" in front only when not enter config mode / assign to interface / resequence**
