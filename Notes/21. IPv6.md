### IPv6
- 128 bits
- 4 bits = 1 hex; 4 hex = 1 octet
- /64 (i.e. first 64 bits are network portion)
- shorten ip addr:
    1. leading 0s can be removed
        - 2001:0D88:000A:001B:20A1:0020:0080:34BD
        - 2001:D88:A:1B:20A1:20:80:34BD
    2. consecutive quarters of all 0s can be replaced by (::)
        - 2001:0D88:0000:0000:0000:0000:0080:34BD
        - 2001:D88::80:34BD

        - 2001:0000:0000:0000:20A1:0000:0000:34BD
        - 2001::20A1:0:0:34BD (:: can only used once)
- find IPv6 prefix
    1. 300D:00F2:0B34:0000:0000:0000:1200:0001/48
       = 300D:F2:B34::

    2. 300D:00F2:0B34:2100:0000:0000:1200:0001/56
       = 300D:F2:B34:2100:: (00 after 21 could not be removed as it is not leading 0s)

    3. 2001:0D88:8D00:0001:FB89:017B:0020:0011/93
       = 2001:D88:8D00:1:FB89:178::
- EUI-64 (Extended Unique Identifier)
    - convert MAC into 64-bit interface identifier (host portion /64 address)
    - Steps:
        1. Divide MAC into half
        2. Inser FFFE in the middle
        3. Change 7th bit (aka Universal/Local bit (U/L bit)) from 1 to 0, vice versa
        e.g. 1234 5678 90AB
             = 1234 56FF FE78 90AB
             = 1034 56FF FE78 90AB

    - Two types MAC address
        1. UAA (Universally Administrated Address) - uniquely identified to the device by the manufacturer
        2. LAA (Locally Administrated Address) - manually assigned by an admin (not globally unique)
    - For 7th bit of MAC address
        - 0 = UAA
        - 1 = LAA
    - For 7th bit of IPv6 Address/EUI-64
        - 0 = LAA
        - 1 = UAA

## IPv6 Address Type
### 1. Global Unicast Address
- for end-host (aka not private)
- normally enterprise requesting IPv6 address from their ISP will receive /48 block
- 16 bits to make subnets
- address block: 2000::/3 (2000:: to 3FFF:FFFF:FFFF...)
- e.g. aaaa:bbbb:cccc:dddd:eeee:ffff:1111:2222
    - global routing prefix (assigned by ISP): aaaa:bbbb:cccc
    - subnet identifier: dddd
    - host portion: eeee:ffff:1111:2222

### 2. Unique Local Address
- private address which cannot be used over the Internet
- don't need to be globally unique
- address block: FC00::/7 (FC00:: to FDFF:FFFF:FFFF...)
    - however 8th bit must set to 1, so the first two digits must be FD
- global ID should be unique to avoid address overlap when companies merge
- e.g. FD45:93AC:8A8F:0001:0000:0000:0000:0001/64
    - indicate unique local address: FD
    - global id: 45:93AC:8A8F
    - subnet identifier: 0001
    - host portion: 0000:0000:0000:0001

### 3. Link Local Address
- `ipv6 enable` - automatically generate IPv6 address on interface using EUI rules
- interface id is generated by eui-64
- cannot route between different subnet (router will not route the packet)
- application:
    - routing protocol peerings (used by OSPFv4 for neighbor adjacencies)
    - next hop address for static routes
    - Neighbour Disovery Protocol (NDP)
- addresss block: FE80::/10 (FE80:: to FEBEF:FFFF:FFFF...)
    - however 54 bits after should all set to 0, so the first three digits must be FE8

### 4. Multicast Address
- IPv6 don't have broadcast address
- address block: FF00::/8 (FF00:: to FFFF:FFFF:FFFF...)
- scope:
    1. Interface-local (FF01)
        - stay in local device
        - send traffic within the local device
    2. Link-local (FF02)
        - stay in local subnet
    3. Site-local (FF05)
        - stay in WAN
        - can be forwarded by routers
    4. Organization-local (FF08)
        - stay in company/organization
    5. Global (FF0E)F
        - no boundaries
<br>

| Purpose | IPv6 | IPv4 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| All nodes/hosts (like broadcast) | FF02::1 | 224.0.0.1 |
| All routers | FF02::2 | 224.0.0.2 |
| All OSPF routers | FF02::5 | 224.0.0.5 |
| All OSPF DRs/BDRs | FF02::6 | 224.0.0.6 |
| All RIP routers | FF02::9 | 224.0.0.9 |
| All EIGRP routers | FF02::A | 224.0.0.10 |

### Anycast Address
- one-to-one-of-many
- how it works:
    - multiple routers configured with the same IPv6 address
    - they use routing protocol to advertise the address
    - router will forward packet to the nearest router with that IP address configured (based on routing metric)
- specify regular unicast address (global unicast / unique local) as anycast address

### Unspecified address
- :: (all 0s)
- default route = ::/0

### Loopback Address
- ::1

### IPv6 Header
1. Version (4 bits)
- 0b0110

2. Traffic Class (8 bits)
- for QoS

3. Flow Label (20 bits)
- used to identify specific traffic flows

4. Payload length (16 bits)
- indicate the length of payload in **byte**
- not including length of IPv6 header (40 bytes)

5. Next Header (8 bits)
- same as Protocol field in Ipv4

6. Hop Limit (8 bits)
- same as TTL field

7. Source/Destination (128 bits each)

### Solicited-Node Multicast Address
- used for Neighbour Discovery Protocol (NDP)
- ff02::1:ff + (last 6 hex char in unicast addr)
- e.g. 2001:db8:ef8:22ff:fe36:8500
- = ff02::1:ff36:8500

### Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)
- function like ARP as ARP is not used in IPv6
- use ICMPv6 and solicited-node multicast address to **learn MAC address** of other hosts
    - two message used:
        1. Neighbor Solicitation (NS) = ICMPv6 Type 135
            - source IP: source Ipv6 addr
            - destination IP: other host's solicited-node multicast address (i.e. ff02::1:ffxx:xxxx, where xx:xxxx is last 6 hex char)
            - source MAC: source MAC addr
            - destination MAC: Multicast MAC based on the solicited-node address (i.e. IPv6mcast_ff:xx:xx:xx, where xx:xx:xx is the last 6 char)
        2. Neighbor Advertisement (NA) = ICMPv6 Type 136
            - use all known IP adn MAC addr
- discover routers 
    - two message used:
        1. Router Solicitation (RS) - ICMPv6 Type 133
            - send to multicast address FF02::2
            - ask all routers on the local link to identify themselves
            - send when an interface is enabled
        2. Router Advertisement (RA) - ICMPv6 Type 134
            - send to multicast address FF02::1
            - to inform other router about its presence
            - send in response to RS messages, but it also send periodically even not receiving RS

### Stateless Address Auto-Configuration (SLAAC)
- don't need to enter the prefix
- host use RS/RA message to learn IPv6 prefix of local link
- generate IPv6 address using eui-64

### Duplicate Address Detection (DAD)
- allow host to check if other device using the same IPv6 address
- enabled when interface is enabled or IPv6 address is configured on the interface
- host send NS message to its own solicited-node multicast address
- if get NA means there is duplicate; else unique

### Configuration
- `ipv6 unicast-routing` - enable ipv6 routing on a router **(global config)**
- `ipv6 address <ip addr>/<prefix length>` - assign ip address on an interface
- `ipv6 address <ip addr>/<prefix length> eui-64` - assign ip address on an interface with eui-64 generator
- `ipv6 address <ip addr>/<prefix length> anycast` - assign anycast address
- `show ipv6 interface brief` - show all the ipv6 configured
- `show ipv6 neighbor` - show all the IPv6 neighbor after NDP
- `ipv6 address autoconfig` - enable SLAAC on an interface **(interface config)**
- `show ipv6 route`
- `ipv6 route <destination subnet> <exit interface> <next hop> <ad>`
    - exit interface only (directly attached) - not gonna work for Ethernet
    - next hop only (recursive)
    - both (fully specified, must be used in link-local nexthop)
    - for floating static, always set AD to value higher than the AD of routing protocol used
