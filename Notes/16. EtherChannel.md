**Access Layer Switch (ASW)** - switch that end hosts connect to

**Distribution Layer Switch (DSW)** - switch that access layer switches connect to

**Oversubscription** - bandwidth of interfaces connected to end hosts > bandwith of the connection to DSW (too much will cause network congestion)

### EtherChannel
- groups multiple interfaces together to act as a single interface
- traffic will be load balanced among the physical interfaces in the group
    - load balanced based on flows (communicatoin between two nodes)
    - same flow will be forwarded using the same physical interface, or else frames may arrive out of order
    - interface selection calculation is performed
    - calculation input type:
        - source MAC
        - destination MAC
        - both source and destination MAC
        - source IP
        - destination IP
        - both source and destination IP
    - `show etherchannel load-balance` - view etherchannel load balancing configuration
    - `port-channel load-balance <input type>` - change how the calculation is carried out
- methods of EtherChannel configurations:
    1. PAgP (Port Aggregation Protocol)
        - only can be used on Cisco switches
        - dynamically negotiate creation/maintenance of EtherChannel
        - only allow up to 8 interfaces
    2. LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol)
        - IEEE 802.3ad
        - dynamically negotiate creation/maintenance of EtherChannel
        - allow 16 interfaces (8 active, 8 standby)
    3. Static EtherChannel
        - interfaces are statically configured to form an EtherChannel
        - only allow up to 8 interfaces

    - `channel-group <etherchannel num> mode <config mode>`
        - PAgP
            - same as DTP autonegotiation
            - auto + auto = no EtherChannel
            - auto + desirable = EtherChannel
            - desirable + desirable = EtherChannel
        - LACP
            - passive + passive = no EtherChannel (created but can't function)
            - passive + active = EtherChannel
            - active + active = EtherChannel
        - static
            - on + on = EtherChannel
            - on + active = no EtherChannel
            - on + active = no EtherChannel
    - `channel-protocol <config method>` - change the protocol used for the configuration
        - not important as `channel-group <val> mode <mode>` will determine what protocol to be used
    - `interface port-channel <etherchannel num>` - enter port channel configuration
        - can set the switchport and encapsulation mode all in one shot for all the interfaces included in the etherchannel
        - ensure all the interfaces has the same configuration 
        - duplex + speed + allowed VLANs + switchport mode must match to form etherchannel
    - `show etherchannel summary` - show summary of all etherchannel
    - `show etherchannel port-channel` - same as `show etherchanne summary` (preferred)
