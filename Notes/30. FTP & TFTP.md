### File Transfer Protocol (FTP) & Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)
- client-server model
    - client use FTP/TFTP to copy files to/from a server
- used to upgrade the OS of a network device
- used to download newer version of IOS from server then reboot the device with new IOS image

### TFTP
- simpler than FTP
    - used in controlled environment to transfer small files quickly
    - no authentication 
    - no encryption
- use UDP port 69
- use lock-step communication
    - server send data
    - client send ack message 
    - server send data
    - client send ack message 
              .
              .
              .

    - client and server alternately send message then wait for a reply (retransmission are sent if required)

- connection has three phrase:
    1. Connection
        - client send read request
        - server responds back with data
    2. Data Transfer
        - server send data 
        - client send acknowledgements
    3. Connection Terminations
        - last data message sent by server
        - client make last acknowledgement

- UDP port 69 is only used in the read request message, TFTP ID (Transfer Identifier) which is a random ephemeral port is used for the rest of the message 

### File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
- use TCP port 20/21
- username and password are used for authentication
- no encryption
- more secure: FTPS (FTP over SSL/TLS)
- another protocol: SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)
- client not only can do file transfer, but also can navigate file dir and remove dir
- Working Principle:
    1. FTP control connection (TCP 21) is established and used to send FTP commands and replies
    2. In FTP Active mode, server initiate FTP data connection (TCP 20)
    3. IN FTP Passive mode (i.e. client behind firewall), client initiate FTP data connection (TCP 20)
        - firewall don't permit outside device to initiate connection


### FTP vs TFTP
| FTP | TFTP |
| --- | --- |
| Use TCP 20 for data, TCP 21 for control for connection-based communication | Use UDP 69 for connectionless communication |
| Client use FTP not just copy file but other actions | Clients can only copy files to/from the server |
| username/pw authentication | No authentication
| No encryption | No encryption |
| Complex | Simple |

### IOS File System
- `show file systems` - view file systems 
- file type:
    - disk: storage device like flash memory
    - opaque: used for internal function
    - nvram: non-volatile RAM (startup config store here)
    - network: external file systems (e.g. FTP/TFTP servers)

### Upgrading Cisco IOS (TFTP)
1. Check current IOS version
    - `show version`
    - `show flash` - view the contents of flash

2. Copy files (TFTP)
    - `copy <source=tftp:> <destination=flash:>` - copy files from source to destination specified

3. Reboot
    - `boot system <filepath>` - tell device to use which IOS file
    **Remember save configuration after this**
    - `reload`

4. Remove old IOS file
    - `delete <filepath>`

### Upgrading Cisco IOS (FTP)
1. Check current IOS version
    - `show version`
    - `show flash`

2. Configure FTP username/password
    - `ip ftp username <username>`
    - `ip ftp password <password>`

3. Copy files (FTP)
    - `copy <source=ftp:> <destination=flash:>`

4. Reboot
    - `boot system <filepath>`
    - `reload`

5. Remove old IOS file
    - `delete <filepath>`
