### Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP)
- allows Cisco Switches to dynamically determine their interface status (access / trunk) without manual configuration
- should disabled on all switchports (security purposes)
- DTP will not form a trunk with a router or PC (have to configure manually)
- `switchport mode dynamic desirable` 
    - actively try to form a trunk with other Cisco Switches
    - only operate as access mode when other switches' mode is statis access
- `switchport mode dynamic auto`
    - not actively try to form a trunk with other Cisco Switches
- `switchport nonegotiate`
    - disable DTP negotiation
    - `switchport mode access` will also do the same thing
- switches that support both 802.1Q and ISL use DTOp to negotiate the encapsulation - `switchport trunk encapsulation negotiate`
    - If both switches support ISL, ISL will be chosen
    - DTP frames sent in VLAN1 (ISL) / Native VLAN: VLAN1 (Default) (802.1Q) 

### VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP)
- allows to configure VLANs on a central VTP server switch 
- other switches synchronize their VLAN database to the server
- VTP Version 1/2/3
- VTP Modes: Server (Default) / Client / Transparent
    - Server:
        - can add / modify / delete VLANs
        - store VLAN database in non-volatile RAM (NVRAM)
        - increase revision number for every changes
        - advertise latest version of VLAN database and let VTP clients to synchronize their VLAN database to it
        - VTP server synchronize to another VTP server with higher revision number 
    - Client:
        - cannot add / modify / delete VLANs
        - only store VLAN database in NVRAM (V3)
        - synchronize database to the server with highest revision domain in their **VTP domain**
        - advertise their VLAN database and forward it to other clients over the trunk ports
    - Transparent:
        - maintain its own VLAN database in NVRAM
        - not sync its VLAN database to server/client in the same domain (but it will forward the advertisement)
- `show vtp status` - view VTP status
- `vtp domain <domain name>` - change VTP domain 
- `vtp version <version num>` - change VTP version
- `vtp mode <vtp mode>` - change VTP mode
- `vtp password <password>` - change VTP password (only sync switch VLAN database if password matches)
    - default: Null
    - switches with no VTP domain receive VTP advertisement with a domain name, it will join that domain
- Change VTP domain to unused domain **AND** Change mode to Transparent **resets revision number to 0**
