### Dynamic Routing
- routers advertise information about the router they know to other routers
- forming "neighbourships" with adjacent routers to exchange the information
- if multiple routes exist, router determine which route is superior and add to routing table (lower metric = superior)
- two dynamic routing protocols:
    1. Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)
        - used to share routes within an autonomous system (AS) / organization
        - algorithm used:
            1. Distance Vector
                - routing by rumor - router only knows the information that its neighbour tell it (matric & next-hop router)
                - Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
                - Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)
            2. Link State
                - each router create a connectivity map, used to calculate the best routes to each destination 
                - Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
                - Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS)
    2. Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP)
        - used to share routes between different ASs
        - algorithm used:
            1. Path Vector
                - Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)

### Dynamic Routing Protocol Metrics
- determine which route is the best
- each protocol use different metrics
- lower metric = better
- if two routes have same routing protocol + destination + metric, both will be added to the routing table (= Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP))
- metrics from different IGP cannot be compared 
- administrative distance (AD) is used to determine which routing protocol is preferred (lower better)
- to change AD of static route: `ip route <network addr> <subnet mask> <next hop> <AD val>` - become floating static route

| IGP Protocol | Metric | Explaination |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RIP | Hop Count | each path counts as one hop (regardless of speed) |
| EIGRP | Based on bandwidth & delay (default) | bandwidth of slowest link and total delay of all links are used |
| OSPF | Cost | Calculated based on bandwidth |
| IS-IS | Cost | Total cost of each link (cost of each link is 10) |

<br>

| Route Protocol | AD |
| --- | --- |
| Directly Connected | 0 |
| Static | 1 |
| External BGP (eBGP) | 20 |
| EIGRP | 90 |
| IGRP | 100 |
| OSPF | 110 |
| IS-IS | 115 |
| RIP | 120 |
| EIGRP (external) | 170 |
| Internal BGP (iBGP) | 200 |
| Unusable route | 255 |

### Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
- maximum hop count = 15
- RIPv1 & RIPv2 = IPv4; RIPng = IPv6
    | RIPv1 | RIPv2 |
    | --- | --- |
    | X support VLSM & CIDR | Support VLSM & CIDR |
    | X include subnet mask info in advertisement | Include subnet mask info in advertisement |
    | messages broadcast to 255.255.255.255 | messages multicast to 224.0.0.9 |
- Two message type 
    - Request: ask neighbour routers to send their routing table
    - Response: send its routing table to neighbour routers
- share routing table every 30 sec
- Command
    - `router rip` - enter router RIP protocol configuration mode
    - `version <version>` - determine which version of RIP is used
    - `no auto-summary` - disable auto-summary
        - auto-summary: automatically summarize along classful network boundaries
        - 10.0.18.0 -> 10.0.0.0
    - `network <network addr>` - activate interface which its ip address is under this network address
    - `passive interface <interface id>` - tell the router to stop sending RIP advertisement our of the specified interface
        - usually used for interface that are connected to non-RIP-enabled device/routers
    - `default-information originate` - advertise its default router to neighbour routers 
    - `show ip protocols` - show the details of routing protocol used
    - `maximum-paths <val>` - define maximum number of paths
    - `distance <val>` - define administrative distance


### Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)
- faster RIP in reacting to changes in the network
- no hop count limit
- multicast to 224.0.0.10
- the only IGP that can perform unequal-cost load-balancing (default: ECMP load-balancing over 4 paths like RIP)
- metric is calculated with formula: **bandwidth of the slowest link + delay of all links**
- Terminology:
    - **Feasible Distance** - router's metric calue to the route's destination
    - **Reported Distance/Advertised Distance** = neighbour's metric value to the route's distance
    - **Successor** - route with the lowest metric (aka lowest feasible distance)
    - **Feasible Successor** - alternate route to te destination which meets the feasible condition
    - **Feasible Condition** - reported distance < successor route's feasible distance
- Command:
    - `router eigrp <AS val>` - enter router EIGRP configuration mode
    - `no auto-summary`
    - `passive interface <interface id>`
    - `network <network addr>`
    - `network <ip addr> <subnet mask>` - same as previous command but it won't assume a classful address
        - e.g. `network 172.16.1.0 0.0.0.15`
        - 0.0.0.15 is wildcard masks (0s -> 1s; 1s -> 0s from subnet mask)
    - `show ip protocols`
        - Selection of router-id
            1. manual configuration (highest)
            2. highest ip addr on a loopback interface
            3. highest ip addr on a physical interface (lowest)
        - `eigrp router-id <router id>` - manually define the router-id
        - `variance <val>` - set the variance
            - **feasible successor** routes with an Feasible Distance up to (?)x the **successor** route's Feasible Distance can be used to load-balance
            - default: 1x
    - `show ip eigrp neighbors` - show neighbour routers that use eigrp
    - **[NORMAL ROUTER CONFIG COMMAND]** `interface loopback <loopback no>` - create loopback address then use `ip addr <> <>` to assign ip to that loopback address
    - `do show ip eigrp topology` - show more details on the eigrp
